# Research on place making in Berlin
In May 2023, Liu, researcher from Life itself Research lab, visited one of the Berlin place making lab. 
In this blog we describe the context of place making and how it is related to transformations in our cities,.

## What is place making?
Place-making is easy to explain, any action, which consists of creating a place, taking action in that space.
Place-making initiatives range from the restructuring of segregated communities in the United States, exemplified by Jane Jacobs' efforts in "Making American cities great again," to place-making endeavors involving young people and marginalized communities in Brussels, one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. 


As French philosopher Lefebvre mentions in his book "La Production de L'Espace" (1974) each form of society 
produces its own space, which in continually reciprocal process, conditioning the societal systems.
Place defining society and society defining place are complex processes, interrelating and one through the other. 
Rarely nowadays one can participate openly in place-making activities, where you as a citizen can participate in taking actions, constructing pieces of complex system, such as cities, especially large cities.
At the same time, large cities are a new phenomenon in urban history 
with a population beyond 8 million inhabitants. 
One of the most relevant topics for metropolitan development is that of the form of governance of these big cities, directing different issues such as urban planning, the creation of governmental functionalities. 

# Place making event in Berlin
Urban Foxes created a possibility for citizens to participate in those activities, such as place-making, projects frequently intertwining with activities aimed at creating a sense of meaning and understanding.

Why place making in Berlin?
In Berlin we have been working on place making activity with citizens.
Having many open territories still having either a special statuses or being empty (on extended meaning of the word "empty space" see below) 
after the Second World War Berlin leaves a lot of opportunities for researchers, urbanists, place-makers to come and contribute to the space liveliness.

## Extended empty space 

What is actually an empty space? Can place be empty? There are always many memories, associated with each space. Especially in space, like Berlin. 
For digging deeper into it, we interacted with reserachers/audio-walkers who designed space-based walks through Berlin places, where not all spaces were yet taken. 
One being done by Katja.

## Project on place making 

Project was organised and coordinated by the Erasmus+ project https://cisr-berlin.org/wakeupcities
