# Place making event in Berlin

Why place making?
In Berlin we have been working on place making activity with citizens.
Why Berlin? Having many open territories still having either a special statuses or being empty (on extended meaning of the word "empty space" see below) 
after the Second World War Berlin leaves a lot of opportunities for researchers, urbanists, place-makers to come and contribute to the space liveliness. 


## Extended empty space 

What is actually an empty space? Can place be empty? There are always many memories, associated with each space. Especially in space, like Berlin. 
For digging deeper into it, we interacted with reserachers/audio-walkers who designed space-based walks through Berlin places, where not all spaces were yet taken. 
One being done by Ekaterina/csir.
